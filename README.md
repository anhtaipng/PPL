# BKU-CSE-PPL

Projects in course Principles of Programming Language - BKU (HCMUT)

Hope this repo will help some BKUer pass the death course PPL in third-year. Because my assignment 1 is quite bad so you should use file .g4 in my assignment 2. It will ensure more accuracy than file .g4 in the assignment 1.

My scores through each assignment:
Assignment 1 : 156/200
Assignment 2 : 100/100
Assignment 3 : 90/100
